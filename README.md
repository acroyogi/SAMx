# SAMx
Meta Segment Anything, gCustom edition - test 2024-10

this is my working project to make a quick and dirty demo
of a specific application: weapons detection (specifically, firearms)
using Meta SAM.

the defaluty object recog is "person. gun. face."

we should explore other nouns for weapons, including:
- gun
- firearm
- handgun
- glock
- rifle
- AR-15

AND
- knife

There is also currently some instability around order of object nouns
(search terms). As in "person. gun. face." performs far better than
"gun." or even "face. gun."

why is this?
merits investigation
